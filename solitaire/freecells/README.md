2. Building during play.

The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.
Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.
Bases are built up by suit.

3. Moves.

Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau,
or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its base.

4. Victory.

The game is won after all cards are moved to their base piles.
